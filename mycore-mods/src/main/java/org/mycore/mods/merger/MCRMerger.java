 * MCRMerger is the main and default implementation for comparing
 * and merging MODS elements that are semantically the same.
 * Each MODS element is wrapped by an instance of MCRMerger or one of its subclasses.
 * It contains methods to decide whether the two MODS elements are equal, or probably represent the information
 * maybe with different granularity.
 * If so, the text, elements and attributes are merged so that the "better" information/representation wins.
 * This is done recursively for all child elements, too.

# How to contribute

- At first you should create a [jira account](https://www.mycore.de/documentation/developer/dev_jira/). With a few exceptions every pull request needs a Jira-Ticket.
- Your code should match the [MyCoRe Code Style](https://www.mycore.de/documentation/developer/codestyle/) and the [MyCoRe Naming Conventions](https://www.mycore.de/documentation/developer/conventions/).
- MyCoRe follows the [agis-:Git-Style-Guide](https://github.com/agis-/git-style-guide) with the following exceptions:
  - Subject to commits is in form: `{JIRA-Ticket} {Ticket summary} {Commit summary}`, like `MCR-1393 Git-Migration add .travis.yml`
  - Branch name to work on a ticket is in form: `issues/{JIRA-Ticket}-{Ticket_Summary}`, like `issues/MCR-1393-Git_Migration`

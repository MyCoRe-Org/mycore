/**
 * Experimental class to improve performance on delete and import operations.
 * You can mark object's as "will be deleted" or "will be imported". You can
 * use this information on {@link MCREventHandler}'s to exclude those
 * marked objects from operations which makes no sense.
 *
 * <h1>
 * Current delete behavior:
 * </h1>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>An user delete's a parent object with 500 children.</li>
 *   <li>MyCoRe tries to delete the parent, but first, it has to delete all children.</li>
 *   <li>MyCoRe runs through each child and deletes it.</li>
 *   <li><b>BUT</b> after the deletion of <b>ONE</b> child, the parent object will be updated.</li>
 *   <li>This results in updating the parent 500 times, before its actually deleted.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * What this class tries to solve:<br>
 * We mark the parent as "will be deleted". When a child is deleted, and the EventHandler tries
 * to removed the child from its parent, the parent will not be updated because its "marked as
 * deleted".
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>
 * Current import behavior:
 * </h1>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>An import is started with a bunch of hierarchic objects.</li>
 *   <li>MyCoRe imports all the objects and does a "create" update.</li>
 *   <li><b>BUT</b> for each object created the parent is updated again (because a child was added)!</li>
 *   <li>This results in unnecessary updates.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * What this class tries to solve:<br>
 * We mark all objects as "will be imported". On import, we ignore all solr index call for
 * those objects. After the import, we delete all marks and do an solr import for all
 * objects at once.
 * </p>

 * TODO: check side effects

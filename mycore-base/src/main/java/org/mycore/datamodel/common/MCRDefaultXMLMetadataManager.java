/**
 * Manages persistence of MCRObject and MCRDerivate xml metadata.
 * Provides methods to create, retrieve, update and delete object metadata
 * using IFS2 MCRMetadataStore instances.
 * <p>
 * For configuration, at least the following properties must be set:
 * <p>
 * MCR.Metadata.Store.BaseDir=/path/to/metadata/dir
 * MCR.Metadata.Store.SVNBase=file:///path/to/local/svndir/
 * <p>
 * Both directories will be created if they do not exist yet.
 * For each project and type, a subdirectory will be created,
 * for example %MCR.Metadata.Store.BaseDir%/DocPortal/document/.
 * <p>
 * The default IFS2 store is MCRVersioningMetadataStore, which
 * versions metadata using SVN in local repositories below SVNBase.
 * If you do not want versioning and would like to have better
 * performance, change the following property to
 * <p>
 * MCR.Metadata.Store.DefaultClass=org.mycore.datamodel.ifs2.MCRMetadataStore
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to change individual properties per project and object type
 * and overwrite the defaults, for example
 * <p>
 * MCR.IFS2.Store.Class=org.mycore.datamodel.ifs2.MCRVersioningMetadataStore
 * MCR.IFS2.Store.SVNRepositoryURL=file:///use/other/location/for/document/versions/
 * MCR.IFS2.Store.SlotLayout=2-2-2-2
 * <p>
 * See documentation of MCRStore and MCRMetadataStore for details.

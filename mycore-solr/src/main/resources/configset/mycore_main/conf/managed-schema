 This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
 It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box.

 PERFORMANCE NOTE: this schema includes many optional features and should not
 be used for benchmarking.  To improve performance one could
  - set stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you
    only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original
    value.
  - set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the field, but only
    return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields.
  - remove all unneeded copyField statements
  - for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false
    for all general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the
    catchall "text" field, and use that for searching.

<schema name="default-config" version="1.6">
    <!-- attribute "name" is the name of this schema and is only used for display purposes.
       version="x.y" is Solr's version number for the schema syntax and 
       semantics.  It should not normally be changed by applications.

       1.0: multiValued attribute did not exist, all fields are multiValued 
            by nature
       1.1: multiValued attribute introduced, false by default 
       1.2: omitTermFreqAndPositions attribute introduced, true by default 
            except for text fields.
       1.3: removed optional field compress feature
       1.4: autoGeneratePhraseQueries attribute introduced to drive QueryParser
            behavior when a single string produces multiple tokens.  Defaults 
            to off for version >= 1.4
       1.5: omitNorms defaults to true for primitive field types 
            (int, float, boolean, string...)
       1.6: useDocValuesAsStored defaults to true.

    <!-- Valid attributes for fields:
     name: mandatory - the name for the field
     type: mandatory - the name of a field type from the 
       fieldTypes section
     indexed: true if this field should be indexed (searchable or sortable)
     stored: true if this field should be retrievable
     docValues: true if this field should have doc values. Doc Values is
       recommended (required, if you are using *Point fields) for faceting,
       grouping, sorting and function queries. Doc Values will make the index
       faster to load, more NRT-friendly and more memory-efficient. 
       They are currently only supported by StrField, UUIDField, all 
       *PointFields, and depending on the field type, they might require
       the field to be single-valued, be required or have a default value
       (check the documentation of the field type you're interested in for
       more information)
     multiValued: true if this field may contain multiple values per document
     omitNorms: (expert) set to true to omit the norms associated with
       this field (this disables length normalization and index-time
       boosting for the field, and saves some memory).  Only full-text
       fields or fields that need an index-time boost need norms.
       Norms are omitted for primitive (non-analyzed) types by default.
     termVectors: [false] set to true to store the term vector for a
       given field.
       When using MoreLikeThis, fields used for similarity should be
       stored for best performance.
     termPositions: Store position information with the term vector.  
       This will increase storage costs.
     termOffsets: Store offset information with the term vector. This 
       will increase storage costs.
     required: The field is required.  It will throw an error if the
       value does not exist
     default: a value that should be used if no value is specified
       when adding a document.

    <!-- field names should consist of alphanumeric or underscore characters only and
      not start with a digit.  This is not currently strictly enforced,
      but other field names will not have first class support from all components
      and back compatibility is not guaranteed.  Names with both leading and
      trailing underscores (e.g. _version_) are reserved.

    <!-- In this _default configset, only four fields are pre-declared:
         id, _version_, and _text_ and _root_. All other fields will be type guessed and added via the
         "add-unknown-fields-to-the-schema" update request processor chain declared in solrconfig.xml.
         
         Note that many dynamic fields are also defined - you can use them to specify a 
         field's type via field naming conventions - see below.
